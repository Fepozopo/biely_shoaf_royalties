# Biely Shoaf Royalties

## Project Overview
The **Biely Shoaf Royalties** project was requested after I made **Biely Shoaf Hotheeets**. It also takes the data from reports in Sage 100, but this time, it puts that data into an excel sheet to keep track of royalty payments to artists. He used to spend hours manually entering this data himself and I made this to save him from that headache.

## Features
- **Royalty Reporting**: Automated processing of royalty data.
- **Sales Tracking**: Easily check sales on a per SKU basis to determine royalties per SKU.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fepozopo/biely_shoaf_royalties.git
2. Install dependencies:
